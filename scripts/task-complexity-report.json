      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Initial Structure",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Spring Boot project setup into specific steps including: 1) Project initialization with build tool configuration, 2) Dependency management setup, 3) Package structure creation, and 4) Application configuration file setup.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward task with clear requirements for project initialization. The complexity is low as it involves standard Spring Boot setup procedures with well-defined dependencies and structure. Breaking it into 4 subtasks allows for methodical implementation of each component."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Board CRUD API",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Board CRUD implementation into: 1) Entity design and validation, 2) Repository layer implementation, 3) Service layer with business logic, 4) Controller endpoints implementation, and 5) Integration testing setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it requires implementing a complete CRUD API with multiple endpoints and business logic. The cyclomatic complexity will increase with each endpoint implementation. Five subtasks allow for separation of concerns across the different architectural layers."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the template management implementation into: 1) OpenStackDeployRequest DTO design with validation, 2) Template engine selection and integration, 3) TfTemplateManager core rendering logic, and 4) Template validation and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing data structures and implementing template rendering logic, which has higher complexity due to the need for dynamic parameter handling and template generation. The Halstead complexity will be higher due to the variety of operators and operands needed for template manipulation."
    },

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement tofumaker API Client",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the API client implementation into: 1) Client configuration and setup, 2) Request methods for template submission, 3) Response handling and parsing, 4) Error handling and retry logic, and 5) Integration test suite with mocked responses.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to external API integration, error handling, and retry mechanisms. The cyclomatic complexity will be significant due to various conditional paths for handling different API responses and error scenarios."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the integration task into: 1) BoardService enhancement for VM creation triggers, 2) VM status integration in board responses, 3) VM deletion workflow on board deletion, 4) Error handling for VM operations in board context, and 5) Integration tests for the combined functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task has significant complexity as it requires coordinating between two major components of the system. The integration points introduce additional complexity in terms of error handling and state management across different domains."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the state tracking implementation into: 1) Entity relationship enhancement between Board and VMResource, 2) Status tracking mechanism design, 3) API response enhancement with VM status, and 4) Real-time update mechanism (polling or callback).",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate to high complexity due to the need for real-time status updates and maintaining consistency between different entities. The state tracking logic adds complexity to the data model and API responses."
    },
